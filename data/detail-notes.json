  "title": "Layout of the Keyboard",
  "content": "The keyboard layout shows how keys are arranged on a computer keyboard. Knowing the layout helps you find keys faster and type more correctly. Most computer keyboards use the <b>QWERTY layout</b>, named after the first six letters on the top letter row (Q, W, E, R, T, Y). <br><br><b>1. What is a Keyboard Layout?</b><br>A keyboard layout is the pattern of keys on the keyboard. It tells you where letters, numbers, symbols, and control keys are located. The layout is designed to make typing easy and efficient.<br><br><b>2. The QWERTY Layout</b><br>👉 The QWERTY layout is the most common layout used around the world. <br>👉 It was designed to reduce key jams on old typewriters by spreading out commonly used letters. <br>👉 It helps users type quickly and accurately once they learn the key positions.<br><br><b>3. Main Sections of the Keyboard</b><br>Keyboards are divided into five main groups: <br>✅ <b>Letter Keys</b> – These are the A–Z keys used to type words. <br>✅ <b>Number Keys</b> – These include 0–9 keys above the letters and on the numeric keypad. <br>✅ <b>Function Keys</b> – F1 to F12 are at the top. They perform special actions like opening help, refreshing, or adjusting settings. <br>✅ <b>Navigation Keys</b> – These include the arrow keys, Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down for moving the cursor or scrolling. <br>✅ <b>Special Keys</b> – These include Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Enter, Backspace, and the Spacebar, which help in controlling actions and typing symbols.<br><br><b>4. Other Keyboard Layouts</b><br>👉 <b>AZERTY</b> – Mostly used in France and some European countries. <br>👉 <b>DVORAK</b> – Designed to increase speed and reduce finger movement. <br>👉 <b>QWERTZ</b> – Common in Central Europe. <br>Different layouts are used in different countries and languages.<br><br><b>5. Importance of Knowing the Keyboard Layout</b><br>✅ Helps you locate keys faster. <br>✅ Increases your typing speed. <br>✅ Reduces typing errors. <br>✅ Makes it easier to use shortcuts and special characters.<br><br><img src='images/keyboard_layout.png' alt='Keyboard Layout' class='w-64 mt-2 rounded shadow'><br><br><b>Remember:</b> Practicing regularly with your keyboard layout helps you type confidently without looking at the keys!"

It is how we communicate with computers to make them work. <br>• A **program** is a list of instructions written in a coding language. <br>• Coding helps create things like games, websites, apps, and robots. <br><br>🎯 **Why Learn Coding?** <br>• Coding builds problem-solving and logical thinking skills. <br>• It helps children become creative thinkers and inventors. <br>• It is an important skill for the future because many jobs use computers and technology. <br><br>🧩 **Examples of Coding Languages** <br>• **Scratch** – A fun, colorful, block-based coding language for beginners. <br>• **Python** – Easy to read and great for learning text-based coding. <br>• **JavaScript** – Used to make websites interactive. <br>• **HTML and CSS** – Used to design and build web pages. <br><br>👩‍💻 **How Coding Works** <br>1. You write instructions (code) using a programming language. <br>2. The computer reads and follows the instructions step by step. <br>3. If there are mistakes, you **debug** (fix) the errors. <br>4. You test and improve your program until it works well. <br><br>🚀 **Simple Example** <br>Imagine you want a robot to move forward: <br>• You might write a code like: **move forward 5 steps** <br>• If you want it to turn, you add: **turn right** <br>• Step-by-step, you build commands that make the robot complete a task! <br><br>💬 **Fun Fact:** Coding is like giving instructions to your friend in a game — you must be clear and correct, or your friend might get confused! <br><br>✅ **In Summary:** Coding helps us control computers and make them do useful, fun, and creative things. Anyone can learn coding — start simple and grow with practice! <br><br><img src='images/coding.png' alt='Introduction to Coding' class='w-64 mt-2 rounded shadow'>"

  "title": "Scratch and Block Coding",
  "content": "Scratch is a fun and easy way to learn coding. It uses **colorful visual blocks** instead of complicated text commands. By dragging and connecting these blocks, children can create animations, games, and stories. <br><br>💡 **What is Scratch?** <br>• Scratch is a beginner-friendly programming platform designed for kids. <br>• It teaches how to code by using blocks that fit together like puzzle pieces. <br>• Each block represents an instruction or command. <br>• The blocks control **sprites** (characters or objects) that can move, talk, and react. <br><br>🎮 **How Scratch Works** <br>1. Choose a sprite (character) and a background (stage). <br>2. Drag and drop blocks from the coding area to create a program. <br>3. Snap blocks together in the right order to tell your sprite what to do. <br>4. Click the green flag ▶️ to run your code and watch your project come alive! <br><br>🧩 **Key Coding Concepts You Learn in Scratch** <br>• **Sequencing** – Putting instructions in the correct order so actions happen step by step. <br>• **Loops (Repeat)** – Making actions happen again and again without writing the same code many times. <br>• **Events** – Making something happen when a key is pressed, when the green flag is clicked, or when sprites touch. <br>• **Conditions (If/Then)** – Making decisions, such as: *If the score is 10, show ‘You Win!’* <br>• **Variables** – Storing information like score, time, or player name. <br><br>🌟 **Why Scratch is Great for Kids** <br>• It makes learning coding fun, visual, and creative. <br>• You can make your own cartoons, quizzes, and mini-games. <br>• It encourages problem-solving, logical thinking, and storytelling. <br>• You can share your projects online with friends and see others’ creations. <br><br>✅ **In Summary:** Scratch and block coding help children learn the basics of programming in an exciting way. By snapping colorful blocks together, anyone can build amazing projects and start thinking like a programmer! <br><br><img src='images/scratch.png' alt='Scratch and Block Coding' class='w-64 mt-2 rounded shadow'>"

  "content": "An **algorithm** is a set of clear, step-by-step instructions used to solve a problem or complete a task. Algorithms help us plan what to do and in what order to do it — just like giving directions to a friend or writing a recipe! <br><br>💡 **What is an Algorithm?** <br>• In simple terms, an algorithm tells the computer what steps to take to get the correct result. <br>• Algorithms are the foundation of coding and programming. <br>• Every computer program or game follows an algorithm to work properly. <br><br>🧩 **Examples of Algorithms in Daily Life** <br>• **Making a Sandwich:** <br>1. Take two slices of bread. <br>2. Spread butter or jam. <br>3. Put the slices together. <br>4. Eat your sandwich! <br><br>• **Brushing Your Teeth:** <br>1. Pick up your toothbrush. <br>2. Put toothpaste on it. <br>3. Brush all your teeth. <br>4. Rinse your mouth. <br><br>• **Playing a Game:** <br>1. Start the game. <br>2. Follow the rules. <br>3. Score points. <br>4. Win or try again! <br><br>🧠 **In Coding:** <br>• Algorithms tell the computer what to do step by step. <br>• Programmers write algorithms using coding languages. <br>• Computers can only follow instructions if they are clear and in the correct order. <br><br>🔍 **Why Algorithms Are Important** <br>• They help us solve problems in a logical and organized way. <br>• They make programs work faster and more accurately. <br>• They teach children how to think carefully and plan ahead before coding. <br><br>✅ **In Summary:** Algorithms are like recipes for solving problems. Whether you are cooking, playing, or coding, you follow steps to get things done correctly. That’s exactly what computers do when they follow an algorithm! <br><br><img src='images/algorithms.png' alt='Algorithms for Kids' class='w-64 mt-2 rounded shadow'>"
