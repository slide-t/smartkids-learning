  "title": "Layout of the Keyboard",
  "content": "The keyboard layout shows how keys are arranged on a computer keyboard. Knowing the layout helps you find keys faster and type more correctly. Most computer keyboards use the <b>QWERTY layout</b>, named after the first six letters on the top letter row (Q, W, E, R, T, Y). <br><br><b>1. What is a Keyboard Layout?</b><br>A keyboard layout is the pattern of keys on the keyboard. It tells you where letters, numbers, symbols, and control keys are located. The layout is designed to make typing easy and efficient.<br><br><b>2. The QWERTY Layout</b><br>👉 The QWERTY layout is the most common layout used around the world. <br>👉 It was designed to reduce key jams on old typewriters by spreading out commonly used letters. <br>👉 It helps users type quickly and accurately once they learn the key positions.<br><br><b>3. Main Sections of the Keyboard</b><br>Keyboards are divided into five main groups: <br>✅ <b>Letter Keys</b> – These are the A–Z keys used to type words. <br>✅ <b>Number Keys</b> – These include 0–9 keys above the letters and on the numeric keypad. <br>✅ <b>Function Keys</b> – F1 to F12 are at the top. They perform special actions like opening help, refreshing, or adjusting settings. <br>✅ <b>Navigation Keys</b> – These include the arrow keys, Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down for moving the cursor or scrolling. <br>✅ <b>Special Keys</b> – These include Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Enter, Backspace, and the Spacebar, which help in controlling actions and typing symbols.<br><br><b>4. Other Keyboard Layouts</b><br>👉 <b>AZERTY</b> – Mostly used in France and some European countries. <br>👉 <b>DVORAK</b> – Designed to increase speed and reduce finger movement. <br>👉 <b>QWERTZ</b> – Common in Central Europe. <br>Different layouts are used in different countries and languages.<br><br><b>5. Importance of Knowing the Keyboard Layout</b><br>✅ Helps you locate keys faster. <br>✅ Increases your typing speed. <br>✅ Reduces typing errors. <br>✅ Makes it easier to use shortcuts and special characters.<br><br><img src='images/keyboard_layout.png' alt='Keyboard Layout' class='w-64 mt-2 rounded shadow'><br><br><b>Remember:</b> Practicing regularly with your keyboard layout helps you type confidently without looking at the keys!"
