  "title": "Layout of the Keyboard",
  "content": "The keyboard layout shows how keys are arranged on a computer keyboard. Knowing the layout helps you find keys faster and type more correctly. Most computer keyboards use the <b>QWERTY layout</b>, named after the first six letters on the top letter row (Q, W, E, R, T, Y). <br><br><b>1. What is a Keyboard Layout?</b><br>A keyboard layout is the pattern of keys on the keyboard. It tells you where letters, numbers, symbols, and control keys are located. The layout is designed to make typing easy and efficient.<br><br><b>2. The QWERTY Layout</b><br>ðŸ‘‰ The QWERTY layout is the most common layout used around the world. <br>ðŸ‘‰ It was designed to reduce key jams on old typewriters by spreading out commonly used letters. <br>ðŸ‘‰ It helps users type quickly and accurately once they learn the key positions.<br><br><b>3. Main Sections of the Keyboard</b><br>Keyboards are divided into five main groups: <br>âœ… <b>Letter Keys</b> â€“ These are the Aâ€“Z keys used to type words. <br>âœ… <b>Number Keys</b> â€“ These include 0â€“9 keys above the letters and on the numeric keypad. <br>âœ… <b>Function Keys</b> â€“ F1 to F12 are at the top. They perform special actions like opening help, refreshing, or adjusting settings. <br>âœ… <b>Navigation Keys</b> â€“ These include the arrow keys, Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down for moving the cursor or scrolling. <br>âœ… <b>Special Keys</b> â€“ These include Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Enter, Backspace, and the Spacebar, which help in controlling actions and typing symbols.<br><br><b>4. Other Keyboard Layouts</b><br>ðŸ‘‰ <b>AZERTY</b> â€“ Mostly used in France and some European countries. <br>ðŸ‘‰ <b>DVORAK</b> â€“ Designed to increase speed and reduce finger movement. <br>ðŸ‘‰ <b>QWERTZ</b> â€“ Common in Central Europe. <br>Different layouts are used in different countries and languages.<br><br><b>5. Importance of Knowing the Keyboard Layout</b><br>âœ… Helps you locate keys faster. <br>âœ… Increases your typing speed. <br>âœ… Reduces typing errors. <br>âœ… Makes it easier to use shortcuts and special characters.<br><br><img src='images/keyboard_layout.png' alt='Keyboard Layout' class='w-64 mt-2 rounded shadow'><br><br><b>Remember:</b> Practicing regularly with your keyboard layout helps you type confidently without looking at the keys!"

  "content": "Special keys are the keys on the keyboard that perform specific tasks other than typing letters or numbers. They help control actions, commands, and shortcuts when working on a computer. Learning their functions makes typing faster and more efficient.<br><br><b>1. What Are Special Keys?</b><br>Special keys are designed to perform unique functions. They allow users to delete, move, select, and control operations easily. These keys work alone or in combination with other keys.<br><br><b>2. Examples of Common Special Keys</b><br>ðŸ‘‰ <b>Shift Key</b> â€“ Used to type capital letters or special symbols when held with another key. (Example: Shift + a = A, Shift + 2 = @).<br>ðŸ‘‰ <b>Caps Lock Key</b> â€“ When turned on, all letters you type appear in capital form. Press it again to turn it off.<br>ðŸ‘‰ <b>Tab Key</b> â€“ Moves the cursor to the next tab space or field. Useful in forms and documents.<br>ðŸ‘‰ <b>Enter Key</b> â€“ Used to start a new line in typing or confirm a command.<br>ðŸ‘‰ <b>Backspace Key</b> â€“ Deletes the letter or space to the left of the cursor.<br>ðŸ‘‰ <b>Delete Key</b> â€“ Removes the letter or space to the right of the cursor.<br>ðŸ‘‰ <b>Ctrl (Control) Key</b> â€“ Used with other keys for shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl + C to copy, Ctrl + V to paste).<br>ðŸ‘‰ <b>Alt (Alternate) Key</b> â€“ Works with other keys to perform special commands or access menus (e.g., Alt + Tab to switch between windows).<br>ðŸ‘‰ <b>Esc (Escape) Key</b> â€“ Cancels a task or closes a dialog box.<br>ðŸ‘‰ <b>Spacebar</b> â€“ Adds spaces between words while typing.<br>ðŸ‘‰ <b>Windows Key</b> â€“ Opens the Start menu in Windows computers.<br>ðŸ‘‰ <b>Fn Key</b> â€“ Found mostly on laptops; used to activate secondary functions of other keys (like brightness or volume).<br><br><b>3. Importance of Special Keys</b><br>âœ… Help perform tasks quickly and easily. <br>âœ… Save time by reducing mouse use. <br>âœ… Allow the use of shortcuts for copy, paste, and undo. <br>âœ… Improve speed and efficiency in typing and navigation.<br><br><b>4. Tips for Using Special Keys</b><br>ðŸ‘‰ Practice using common shortcuts daily (like Ctrl + Z to undo mistakes).<br>ðŸ‘‰ Learn the position of each special key for faster access.<br>ðŸ‘‰ Combine special keys with letters to use powerful keyboard commands.<br><br><b>5. Fun Shortcuts to Try</b><br>ðŸ’¡ Ctrl + A â†’ Select All text.<br>ðŸ’¡ Ctrl + S â†’ Save your document.<br>ðŸ’¡ Ctrl + P â†’ Print your file.<br>ðŸ’¡ Alt + F4 â†’ Close the current program.<br><br><img src='images/special_keys.png' alt='Special Keys' class='w-64 mt-2 rounded shadow'><br><br><b>Remember:</b> Special keys are powerful tools that make using your computer faster and easier.

  "content": "Learning how to use the keyboard correctly helps you type faster and more accurately. Typing is an important skill for school work, communication, and computer use. <br><br> <b>1. What is Typing?</b><br>Typing means pressing keys on the keyboard to write words, sentences, or numbers on the screen. Good typing skills save time and make your work neat and professional.<br><br> <b>2. The Home Row Keys</b><br>The home row keys are the base position for your fingers when typing. <br>ðŸ‘‰ Left hand: A, S, D, F <br>ðŸ‘‰ Right hand: J, K, L, ; <br>Your fingers should always return to these keys after pressing other keys. The small bumps on F and J help you find your place without looking down.<br><br> <b>3. Correct Finger Placement</b><br>Each finger has its own keys to press. This helps you type smoothly and without mistakes. <br>ðŸ‘‰ Use your thumbs for the <b>spacebar</b>. <br>ðŸ‘‰ Keep your fingers slightly curved over the home row. <br>ðŸ‘‰ Avoid using one finger for all keys (called 'hunt and peck').<br><br> <b>4. Good Typing Posture</b><br>Sit up straight with both feet flat on the floor. Keep your wrists slightly raised and avoid resting them on the table. Your eyes should look at the screen, not the keyboard.<br><br> <b>5. Practice for Speed and Accuracy</b><br>Typing fast is not as important as typing correctly. Start slowly and focus on hitting the right keys. With daily practice, your speed will naturally increase.<br><br> <b>6. Tips to Improve Typing</b><br>âœ… Practice typing short words, then move to sentences.<br>âœ… Use typing tutor games or practice lessons daily.<br>âœ… Avoid looking at your fingers when typing.<br>âœ… Keep your hands clean and dry before typing.<br><br> <b>7.
